# Windows Audio Switcher

A simple utility to switch between wired and bluetooth audio sinks in Windows. Currently does absolutely nothing besides printing out connected Bluetooth devices.

so my issue is that when i want to connect my airpods to my pc i have to open settings and click "connect"

instead i wanna have a shortcut where i can just be like "ok use this now"
ideally i would push a kb shortcut and switch between audio devices whether or not they are connected
so idk win+some key would bring up a small window with headphones, bt speaker, wired audio and whatever else is plugged in, and if i keep pushing the shortcut it rotates between the known devices 
and if they are not connected it tries to connect
watch apple roll out airpods integration with windows 30 seconds after i put this on github
